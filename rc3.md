#### Function review

##### Function
- What is a function?   
` A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform an action. `  
Unlike a mathematical function, writing a function is actually more similar to writing a procedure of doing some spectfic task.    

- How to write a function in Matlab?
    1. create a .m file
    2. think about the input, output and intermediate procedure
    3. write the header of the function on the **first line** of the .m file (the name of the function must be the same as the name of the .m file)    
    ```matlab
    function [return_values] = function_name(parameters)
    ```
    *return_values* are the *output* of the function, while *parameters* are the *input* of the function.  
    4. fill in the body
    

- How to call a function?  
If you would like to use a function in another script, you can directly call a function.   
```matlab
    [outputs] = function_name(inputs)
    ```
*Note that you must be in the same folder with the function when you need to call it.*

- Function and script
    - script will interact with the variables stored in the workspace (have side effects), while function will not do so (function variables are local to the function itself)
    - script has no input/output arguments, function has

- Call stack  
` Call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about all the functions called by a computer program. It helps each function successfully returns to the function that calls it. `
    - stack: last in first out data structure (like a pile of plates)
    - function call in call stack (assue function A calls function B)
        1. when function A calls function B, we **copy** all the values of the input parameters into B and push B into the stack
        2. perform corresponding operations in function B, compute the return values
        3. when we reach **return** in B or we have already arrived at the end of function B, function B will be popped from the stack, the return value will be received by function A
    - Notices
        1. In the whole process, function B is have no access to any variables of function A
        2. The operation of input parameters of B will not change the corresponding variables in A, since they are a copy of them
        3. Only the return value of B can be received by A

##### Subfunction
- A function written below the main function (the function with the same name as the filename)
- Only can be called in the current function

##### Recursion and Iteration
- Iteration: a situation in which some statements are performed repeatedly in a loop
- Recursion: a situation where a function calls itself repeatedly until some base condition is reached.
- How to write recursion algorithms:
  1. Knowing how to break up a big, complex problem into several similar, small, simple pieces.
  2. Knowing when to stop this breaking up process. 
  
###### Factorial
- Iterative
```matlab
function result=factorial_iteration(n)
    result=1;
    for i = 1:n
        result = result * i;
    end
    return;
end
%
```
- Recursive
```matlab
function result=factorial_recursion(n)
    if n==1
        result = 1;
        return;
    else
        result = n * factorial_recursion(n-1);
        return;
    end
end
%
```
###### Reverse an array
Given a vector or array like [1,2,3,4,5] reverse it.
- Iterative
```matlab
function rst = reverse_iteration(A)
    rst=[];
    for i = 1:length(A)
        rst=[A(i) rst];
    end
    return;
end
%
```
- Recursive
```matlab
function rst = reverse_recursion(A)
    if length(A)==1
        rst = A;
        return;
    else
        rev = reverse_recursion(A(2:end));
        rst = [rev A(1)];
        return;
    end
end
%
```
###### Find smallest element (bisection)
Given a non-empty vector A, return its smallest element.
- Iterative
```matlab
function smallest = find_smallest_iteration(A)
    smallest = A(1);
    for i = 2:length(A)
        if A(i)<smallest
            smallest=A(i);
        end
    end
    return;
end
%
```
- Recursive  
Algorithm 1: the smallest element is either the first or the smallest of the rest elements in an array.  
Algorithm 2: the smallest element is either the smallest in the first half, or the smallest in the second half.  
```matlab
function smallest = find_smallest_recursion(A)
    if length(A) == 1
        smallest = A(1);
        return;
    else
        left = A(1:floor(length(A)/2));
        right = A(floor(length(A)/2)+1:end);
        left_smallest = find_smallest_recursion(left);
        right_smallest = find_smallest_recursion(right);
        if left_smallest < right_smallest
            smallest = left_smallest;
        else
            smallest = right_smallest;
        end
    end
end
%
```
###### Eight queens problem
You are to place 8 chess queens on an 8 Ã— 8 chessboard. These queens refuse to share the same row, the same column or the same diagonal. Find the number of possibilities to place them.   
Solution 1:
```matlab
function count=eight_queen(A,row)
    count=0;
    for col=1:8  
        col_availability=~(sum(A(:,col)));   
        B=zeros(8);
        for a=1:8
            for b=1:8
                if (a-b==row-col)||(a+b==row+col)
                    B(a,b)=1;
                end
            end
        end
        diag_availability=~(sum(A(B==1),'all'));
        if col_availability && diag_availability
            A(row,col)=1;
            if row==8
                count=count+1;
                disp(A);
            else
                count=count+eight_queen(A,row+1);
            end
            A(row,col)=0;
        end
    end   
end
%
```
You can call `eight_queen(zeros(8),1)` to receive the answer.  
Solution 2:  
 ```matlab
function count = queen(pre)
    row = size(pre,2) + 1;
    count = 0;
    for col = 1 : 8
        if row == 1
            count = count + queen([pre [row; col]]);
        elseif isempty(find(pre(2,:)==col)) && isempty(find(sum(pre)==row+col)) && isempty(find(pre(1,:)-pre(2,:)==row-col))
            if row == 8
                count = count + 1;
            else
                count = count + queen([pre [row; col]]);
            end
        end
    end
end
%
 ```
You can call `queen([])` to receive the answer.

#### Plotting
Matlab has a whole catalog including all the related information of figures and images named **Graphics** (under Documentation -> MATLAB -> Graphics).  

##### Basic
- figure: create a figure window
- axes: create, and specify the range of axes in the current figure window
- plot: create a new plot, will cover the prev plot in the same figure window

##### Formatting and Annotation
###### Titles and labels
- title: add title on the top of a figure (LaTeX syntex supported)
- xlabel/ylabel: set axis labels (LaTeX syntex supported)
- legend: add label (curve name) for different plots in a figure window (LaTeX syntex supported)

###### Annotations
- text: ```text(x,y,txt)``` Add text beside a certain data point (x, y)
- line: ``` line([x0 x1],[y0 ,y1])``` Draw a line from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1)
- rectangle: ```rectangle('Position',[left_down_x0 left_down_y0 width height])```  
Add in current plot, so no need to use *hold on* 

##### Others
- subplot: ```subplot(m, n, p)```
- clf: delete all the graphics objects on the current figure 
- hold on/off: retain (or not) the current plot when adding new plots 

#### Advanced topics

##### Data type 
- What is data type? Why we need it?
    - Each variable has a specific data type
    - It tells the interpreter how to allocate memory and how to load and interpret some bits at certain address in memory
    - It defines the operations a certain variable can have
- Different data types in Matlab  
    - int: int8, int16, int32, int64  
      The most significant bit is the sign bit.  
    - uint: uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
    - single(32 bit), double(64 bit)
    - logical
    - char (single quotation mark), string(double quotation mark)  
        - provide storage for text data, but string array treats each phrase as a unit, whereas a char array treats each character as a unit   
        - their ways for storage data is likely to be different  
    eg: Try this in command window
    ```matlab
    chr='abcd';
    chr(1)
    whos chr
    str="abcd";
    str(1)
    whos str
    %
    ```  
        - string specfic functions are both suitable for *string* and *char array* (like str2num, strcmp, strfind, strrep), but the data type of the return value may be affected by your choice
    - cell array
    - structure
    - function handle
    - classes
- Type Conversion  
There are many ways to convert one data type into another in MATLAB.  
eg. convert string into double

```matlab
str = "123.45";
db = str2double(str); % similar to int2str, mat2str, num2str, str2num

db = cast(str,'double')

db = double(str);
%
```

##### Structures
- What is a structure?  
    A structure is a data type that groups related data using data containers called fields
- Initialize a structure
    - specify the name of each field and corresponding values
    - all elements in a typical structure array should have same fields
    - field names should be *char array* or *string*
    ```matlab
students(1) = struct('name',"Jane",'id',"01",'hw',[80,90,80],'mid',100,'final',90);
students(2) = struct('name',"Simon",'id',"02",'hw',[95,85,100],'mid',80,'final',100);
students(3) = struct('name',"Alice",'id',"03",'hw','None','mid',95,'final',95);
% students(4) = struct('name','AAA','id','04');  % will cause an error
% However, the following is correct
students(4).name = "Bob";  % all other fields will be left as empty []
students(4).id = "04";
students(4).hw = [10 20 30];
%
    ```
- Access and modify a field in structure
```matlab
% access/modify a field
students(2).name="XXX";
name_list = [students.name]; % obtain an array of all the names
%
```
