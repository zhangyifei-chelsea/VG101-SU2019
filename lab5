DONT USE array[n] (when n is not a const or macro ...)
malloc the array -> heap  -> enough space
do not use VLA(variable length array) -> in stack -> limited space

speed up -> 2 to sqrt(i) to judge whether i is a prime


ex2

use 
const char *MONTH[12]={"January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"};
this kind of things to substitute switch case!

printf("%4d",i); to print the date!  

ex3
use fgets instead of gets!
gets will omit the \n in the end, but fgets will not
\0 resemble the end of a string, replace the \n with \0!

use strstr or strcmp or strncmp to compare!

ex4
omit

ex5
similar to ex2

sorting algorithm
insertion sort, bubble sort, or etc. 

also for output 
can use 
const char *SUIT[4]={"Spades", "Hearts", "Dia..s", "Clubs"};
and
const char *RANK[13]={"2", "3", "4", ... , "King", "Ace"}

store your card as 0-51, use /13 and %13 to output the suit and club

1) use recursion to construct a 5 level binary tree
2) the default path of Clion for file io is under cmake-build-debug, so you need to put your file there to directly use fopen(filename,'.');
